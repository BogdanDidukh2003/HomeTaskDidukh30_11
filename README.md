Repo with 5th lab
The variant #7 was to create Class Musician and to make festivals that will fit in with maximum budget. 
Objects there are musicians with their names, ages and salaries.
You can create festivals, add members, and if it is over budget, or the musician allready takes pert, then the program will not let you do that.
You can delete members from the fest, and if programm cannot find the musician, it would not let you do that.
To run this program, you must:
1. Create C++ blank project repository in Visual Studio 2019;
2. Add Main.cpp to source files;
3. Add MusicianFestClass.h to header files;
4. Build -> Build solution;
5. Debug programm.
